### Seasonal Job Demand Prediction Project 

### Overview 
This project aims to predict the seasonal demand for different job categories using historical job vacancy data. It serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of using time-series analysis for understanding job market trends. 
While the initial focus is on analyzing past trends and identifying seasonal patterns in job demand, it's important to note that real-world applications of this model would require more comprehensive data. 
Job market dynamics are influenced by a wide array of factors including economic conditions, technological advancements, and legislative changes, which are not fully captured in this prototype. 

### Addressing Limitations 
As a proof of concept, this project highlights the potential of time-series analysis in predicting job category demands. Moving forward, addressing the limitations identified during this initial phase—such as the need for higher temporal resolution and feature diversity—will be crucial. 
Future iterations of this project should aim to include:
 
Monthly or weekly data to better capture short-term fluctuations. 
External factors such as economic indicators, policy changes, and sector-specific trends. 
Advanced machine learning techniques to model complex interactions between various predictors.
